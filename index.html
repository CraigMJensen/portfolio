            <p class=" about-text">
                Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from UT coding bootcamp with a strong background in surgical services and anesthesia.  Coding skills in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Node, Express, MySql, Sequelize, Git, and Linux commands.  I have 20 years of experience in Surgery as a Certified Anesthesia Technician.  My medical background will help me with web development because surgery is a fast-paced, time-sensitive environment with little room for error.  Learning new processes and working with new technologies is taught with a ‘see one, do one, teach one’ mentality in surgery, helping me retain information through doing and teaching while still learning.  Working closely with a team to maintain a clean and efficient workspace has taught me team-work, collaboration, and compromise.  As a technician, I keep the anesthesia machines and devices in safe, working order.  Keeping organized logs of all maintenance and safety checks that are performed and when they are due.</p>
